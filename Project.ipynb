Det er ikke alltid så lett å si hvor vi er fra. Det er rett vi tilhører. Det vi kaller hjem, er der hjertet vårt er. Det kan ikke alltid plasseres innenfor landegrenser. Nordmenn er jenter som er glad i jenter, gutter som er glad i gutter, og jenter og gutter som er glad i hverandre. Nordmenn tror på Gud, Allah, altet og ingenting. Nordmenn liker Grieg, Kygo, Hellbillies og Kari Bremnes. Med andre ord, Norge er dere. Norge er oss. Mitt største håp for Norge er at vi skal klare å ta vare på hverandre.
