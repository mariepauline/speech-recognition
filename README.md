# Welcome!

To run this locally, first you need a local clone of this repo. That is the easiest part! Just go ahead and clone it in your own preferred way.

Then you need to:

1. Open the folder in your preferred IDE or navigate to the folder in the terminal
2. Activate the virtual environment by running:
   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
3. Make sure that all the necessary packages are installed by running:
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. With the virtual environment up and running, start the Jupyter Notebook by either starting the notebook in the terminal with: `jupyter notebook` and navigating to the .ipynb file in your browser, or you can use your favorite IDEs tools. Visual Studio i.e. seems to support it well.
5. Run the code! You can also customize it and run it however you want.
